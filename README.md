# Audit Research & Decision Support Prototype

This repository contains a prototype audit support tool designed to assist tax auditors
in researching and reviewing tax laws, regulations, and official guidance.

## Overview
The notebook demonstrates a retrieval-based approach where:
- Source documents are indexed
- Relevant provisions are retrieved per audit scenario
- A structured audit memorandum is generated with citations

The system is intended to support professional judgment and improve efficiency,
not to replace auditor decision-making.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Add the required API key using Colab Secrets
3. Run all cells from top to bottom
4. Upload demo documents or use the provided synthetic data

## Notes
- Demo documents are synthetic and used for illustration only
- The workflow mirrors real audit research processes
