        "Key lessons from this implementation include:\n",
        "- AI systems are most effective when used as **assistive tools**, not decision-makers\n",
        "- Transparency and source traceability are essential for trust\n",
        "- Structured outputs aligned with real audit workflows are more valuable than free-form answers\n",

        "With appropriate governance, the same approach could be extended to larger document sets, additional tax domains, or integrated audit platforms.\n",

        "Ultimately, the value of the system lies not in automation alone, but in **supporting better, faster, and more consistent professional judgment**.\n",
